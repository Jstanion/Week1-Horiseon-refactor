# Horiseon Code Refactoring

## Description

In this project I took an old source code for the company website and refactored it by adding semantic elements. In addition to semantic elements, there are alt attributes added to all images and icons for better accessibility and search engine optimization. I learned to carefully go through the source code, making incremental changes to prevent any major CSS issues stemming from broken code.

## Usage

The following image is what the page should look like.
