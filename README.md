# Horiseon Code Refactoring

## Description

I was given old source code for a company website that needed refactoring. I applied the following changes to update the source code.

- Added semantic elements and alt attributes to the images for screen reader accessibility.
- Gave the attributes clear descriptions for better search engine optimization.
- Combined and consolidated the CSS code to make navigation and future changes easier.

I learned to carefully go through the source code, making incremental changes to prevent major CSS issues that could stem from broken code.
